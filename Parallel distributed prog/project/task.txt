Common requirements

Each project will have 2 implementations: one with "regular" threads or tasks/futures, and one distributed (possibly, but not required, using MPI). A third implementation, using OpenCL or CUDA, can be made for a bonus.

The documentation will describe:

the algorithms,
the synchronization used in the parallelized variants,
the performance measurements
