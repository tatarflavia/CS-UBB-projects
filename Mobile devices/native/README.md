App description:

Wedding Dresses Shop Administration Mobile Application

We need a mobile application for our store that will be available in Play Store for our administrators as the demand is big for our products and our employees could use this application remotely from anywhere.
Our administrators can change the stock by adding/ removing/ updating details of products. The administrators should see the products, add/ remove/ update details of products. If the app is offline, the changes will be done once the connection to the internet is ok once again. The products last seen on the app should be shown even while offline when entering the app.
