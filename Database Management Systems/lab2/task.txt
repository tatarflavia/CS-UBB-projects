Generalize Lab 1 to work for 2 scenarios (two 1:n relationships).
All queries used to access and manipulate data will be set in the configuration file.
The form should be generic enough such that switching between scenarios comes down to updating
ONLY the configuration file.

HINT: 
Use App.config file. In Form.cs include "using System.Configuration" to be able to use App.config.
