Develop a web application based on JSP (Java Server Pages) or Java Servlets.

All web pages should be accessible only if the user logs in using a username and a password (create a session each time a user logs in, and destroy the session when the user logs out). Have in mind the user experience when you implement the problem:

add different validation logic for input fields
do not force the user to input an ID for an item if he wants to delete/edit/insert it; this should happen automatically (e.g. the user clicks an item from a list, and a page/modal prepopulated with the data for that particular item is opened, where the user can edit it)
add confirmation when the user deletes/cancels an item
do a bare minimum CSS that at least aligns the various input fields



Solve the following problem using the JSP/Servlet technology. 
State information (between web requests) is always stored in a database; 
you may store some state information in cookies/session objects. 
Write a web application for user profile management.
 Before he can use the application, 
the user must be authenticated or he has the option of creating a new account 
(i.e. register). The profile of a user contains the fields: 
name, email address, picture, age, home town. 
A user can search the profile database using any of the above fields or parts of a field.
 The profiles resulted from the search are displayed on the browser window: 
the image, name, email address, age and home town. 
Image files need not be stored on the database. 
A user can also change its profile data.
